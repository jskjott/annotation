# ANNOTATION

## The power of annotations

Annotation can be condensing/curating/commenting/elaborating. Annotation systems are meta-tools which are often not used to generate final products or results: rather they serve as scaffolds augmenting thinking and collaboration processes. This page explores the meaning and design of annotations, the different forms annotations take, and strives to illuminate how meta-tools change how we work with ideas. 

## Definitions and keywords

**Thesaurus** -> note, notation, comment, gloss; footnote; commentary, explanation, interpretation, observation, elucidation, explication, exegesis.

**Oxford's** -> a note by way of explanation or comment added to a text or diagram.

**Webster's** -> a note added by way of comment or explanation.

## Relationship between entity and annotation

* No annotation exists on its own, it must exist in relation to some entity: whether that be a physical object or a piece of media.
* Drastically different narratives surround the entity and the annotion (this is part of the reason the entity and annotation cannot exist as one.)
